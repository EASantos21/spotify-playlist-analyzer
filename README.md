# spotify-playlist-analyzer


## What it does
Gives back stats and an analysis on your Spotify playlist's features.

## Description
If you're like me, making playlists feels somewhat like an art, coordinating lists of songs for certain moods and situations.
You could even say that your playlists are the soundtracks of your life that you get to pick and choose!

However, it can always be difficult maintaining a cohesive and well put together playlist,
which is why I made this simple terminal application.

All you need for the application is to provide a link to your playlist and it'll give you the overall
danceability, energy, and valence of your playlist, explaining when and where your playlist fits!

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Spotipy

## Build Status
- Application is currently only through terminal. Next goal would be to have some sort of UI and better graphics/visualization for user to see.

## Installation and How To Use
1. Simply download dist/showcase.exe
2. Find showcase.exe in the location you have it downloaded
3. Click and run!
4. When finished, you will be prompted to hit any key and enter if you would like to go again, or hit 'E' and enter if you would like to terminate the application.
